When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-When you are collaborating with other people, would like to keep a version in the cloud for easy access, or want to have your code backed up.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-In case there are changes that have to be reviewed or adjusted before sharing your local code with others that you are collaborating with.
