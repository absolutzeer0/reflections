What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
-It creates the .git hidden file that turns the repository into a git repository. If you don't do it, your directory will not become a git repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
-The staging area allows a commit to be built prior to actually performing the commit. It is beneficial because you can change your commit and its message prior to actually committing it.
